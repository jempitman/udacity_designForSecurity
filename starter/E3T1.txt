# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
GuardDuty detected both a high and low severity EC2/SSHBruteForce attack on my account, which correspond with the actions performed in the
defensive security assessment as both the AttackInstance and WedApp instances belong to me. The AttackInstance triggered the high severity 
attack (since it was being used for the attack) and the WebApp triggered the low severity attack (since it was defending against the attack).

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
The low severity attack was triggered by monitoring the VPC flowlogs on port 22, since the attack attempts to guess the password by attempting
multiple logins in a short space of time.
