Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the 
environment in this project.

1. Security groups for the WebApp and AttackInstance EC2 instances are defined in the c3-app.yml file for the c3-app stack (WebAppSG and 
AttackInstanceSG), but should not allow ingress from the public internet (0.0.0.0/0) to high value ports (IDs: EC2.13, EC2.14, EC2.18 and EC2.19). 
Instead, the security groups should only allow least privileged access to these instances. 

This can be remediated by deleting the rule allowing ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 and defining new rules for least privileged access to these resources
with a smaller CIDR block.

2. The default VPC security group for the EC2 instances should not allow inbound or outbound traffic, as it cannot be deleted once deployed 
(ID: EC2.2). to remediate this error, a custom least-privileged security group should be created to limit inbound and outbound traffic to the EC2 instances.

3. The WebApp and AttackInstance EC2 instances should use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) to access temporary, frequently rotated
credentials as IMDSv2 removes the need to hard code or distribute sensitive credentials to the instances (ID: EC2.8). To remediate this error the EC2
instances should be configured with IMDSv2 by setting the `HTTPTokens` field in the MetadataOptions section of the EC2 launch template to required,
 as part of efforts to hardening of the instances from malicious attacks.

4. The WebApp and AttackInstance EC2 instances both have public IP addresses, as they are defined in a default public subnet in c3-app.yml 
(ID: EC2.9). Once assigned, the public IP address cannot be removed, so the instance becomes a target on the public internet. This can be 
remediated by defining these instances in a non-default VPC and disabling the assigning of a public IP address by setting the AssociatePublicIpAddress
property in the EC2 Instance launch template to false in c3-app.yml. 

5. The EC2 subnets defined in c3-vpc.yml should not automatically assign public IP addresses (ID: EC2.15). This can be remediated by the setting
the MapPublicIpOnLaunch property in the subnet definitions in the c3-vpc.yml stack template to false.

6. The free and secret S3 buckets defined in stack template c3-s3.yml should have event notifications enabled (ID: S3.11). This can be remediated
by setting up a SNS topic, SQS queue, Lambda function or EventBridge rule to which notifications can be published whenever a significant event 
occurs in S3.

7.  The free and secret S3 buckets defined in c3-s3.yml should require requests to use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) (ID: S3.5). This can be remediated 
by defining a policy for each bucket in c3-s3.yml that includes the boolean condition aws:SecureTransport that is set to false.

8. The free and secret s3 buckets defined in c3-s3.yml should have server access logging to a chosen target bucket (ID: S3.9), in order to track 
requests made to these buckets. This can be remediated by creating server access logging buckets and setting the LoggingConfiguration property
for the free and secret s3 buckets in the c3-s3.yml stack template to log all requests to these dedicated logging buckets (https://docs.aws.amazon
.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket-loggingconfiguration.html).

9. The WebApp and AttackInstance EC2 instances defined in c3-app.yml should use dedicated VPC endpoints (ID: EC2.10) to establish a private connection
between the EC2 instances and the VPC. This can be remediated by setting the AWS::EC2:VPCEndpoint properties in the c3-app.yml stack template for 
the EC2 instances according to the following template (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-vpcendpoint.html)

10. The network Access Control List (NACL) for the WebApp and AttackInstance EC2 instances should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 or 
port 3389 (ID: EC2.21). This can be remediated by defining an NACL for the WebApp and AttackInstance EC2 instances in the c3-app.yml stack template
that limits the inbound and outbound traffic to the EC2 instances, as an extra layer of protection for ingress to the SSH and RDP ports (22 and 3389).

11. The EBS volumes for the WebApp and AttackInstance EC2 instances should be encrypted at rest by default (ID: EC2.3 and EC2.7). This can be remediated by setting 
the boolean encrypted property to true in the AWS::EC2:Instance Ebs definition in s3-app.yml stack template.

12. The Application load balancer defined in c3-app.yml should be configured to redirect all http requests to https (ID: ELB.1). This can be 
remediated by adding a rule for all http requests entering port 80 to be redirected to https through port 443 or declaring  an 
AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::Listener resource with a default redirect action in the c3-app.yml according to the example in
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-elasticloadbalancingv2-listener.html.
