# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
A NAT gateway could be placed between the application load balancer and the WebApp instance to further shield it from the public internet.
Additionally, the WebApp instance could be placed in a private subnet to limit its access to the internet.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
Yes, a private VPC endpoint would connect the WebApp instance to the s3 bucket through a private gateway instead of through the public access. 
It would essentially only accept requests that were made through the WebApp instance.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, enabling server-side encryption does not change the encryption of existing objects, if they were unencrypted before encryption was enabled,
they will remain unencrypted.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
If the original cloud formation templates were applied to this environment, the conditions would be evaluated with boolean logic, but 
since the security hardening measures contain various explicit deny statements the final decision will to be to deny certain actions.
